Elephant List
============

Elephant list is data structure that allows fast search within an ordered sequence of elements.
It's a mixture of [skip list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list) and [unrolled linked list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unrolled_linked_list),
and runs faster than both of them.
